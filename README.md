## Synopsis 
This is a generator to tell who will do what chores at absolute random. It has a list of big and small chores, and assigns a person to it at random from the input names and number (for the number of people). 
## Code Example

## Motivation
I made this because I feel like the chores should be randomly generated especially for houses like mine with roommates that barely help with the chores. 
## Installation
Download a java editor, download the Chores.java file and then press 'run'.
